Description: Analysis of scRNA-seq data supports the hypothesis that differentiation of intestinal stem cells is impaired in H3T3A mutant. H3 wild-type and H3T3A mutant stem cell samples are each placed into a pseudotime model, and then aligned (DTW). The aligned features are placed into a GLM regression model. The expected change in Delta (Dl) levels is found (decreased slope in H3T3A mutant) but does not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). A complementary marker gene Klumpfuss (klu) is impaired in H3T3A mutant, with a slope near zero in pseudotime (\*\*\*\*, p < 0.0001).
